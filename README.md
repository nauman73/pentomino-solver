# ðŸ§© Pentomino Puzzle Solver

An interactive pentomino puzzle solver featuring a sophisticated Algorithm X + Dancing Links implementation for optimal exact cover solving.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Interactive Puzzle Interface**: Drag, drop, rotate, and flip pentomino pieces
- **Advanced AI Solver**: Algorithm X with Dancing Links for optimal solving
- **Real-time Visualization**: Watch the AI solve step-by-step
- **Customizable Solving**: Adjust speed, randomization, and visualization settings
- **Seeded Randomization**: Reproducible solving with custom seeds
- **Performance Statistics**: Track attempts, backtracks, and cover operations

## ðŸŽ® How to Play

1. **Manual Play**: 
   - Drag pieces from the right panel onto the 8Ã—8 grid
   - Right-click pieces to rotate them
   - Double-click pieces to flip horizontally
   - Double-click placed pieces to remove them

2. **Auto Solver**:
   - Click "ðŸš€ Start Solving" to watch the AI solve automatically
   - Adjust speed and randomization settings for different solving behaviors
   - Use seeds for reproducible solutions

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

Fit all 12 pentomino pieces into the 8Ã—8 grid with the 2Ã—2 center hole (60 squares total).

## ðŸ”¬ Technical Details

- **Algorithm**: Dancing Links implementation of Knuth's Algorithm X
- **Exact Cover Problem**: Each cell must be covered exactly once
- **Optimization**: Minimum remaining values heuristic with randomization
- **Performance**: Handles thousands of backtracking operations efficiently
